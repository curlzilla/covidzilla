coronazilla: 

You're obsessed with coronavirus statistics. You want them now. You want them every 30 seconds. You don't see any need to stream video in order to get that information, because it should just be ASCII text. Well, we solved that for you. Pull the repo, chmod +x coronazilla, kick it off, sit back and watch the slow descent into madness.
